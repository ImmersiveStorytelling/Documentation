For Cloud Applications we started writing a tool for analyzing and managing data from the virtual reality projects. You can find the github page with the code and documentation in the subrepo [CA-immersive @ 67f65e2](https://github.com/ImmersiveStorytelling/CA-immersive/tree/67f65e2058f96d59a7067f35b5a23d68530ac501).
